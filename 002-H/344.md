# Users can update and delete others' queues at will

## Summary
This `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] ` is updated each time the `enlistInRollover()` function is called. If user calls the function multiple times, it can be updated to someone else's index, so it can update and delete someone else's queue.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `enlistInRollover()` is used to enlists in rollover queue.If user  queue up a rollover for the first time, the protocol will add to queue. If user has already queued up a rollover ,then update the queue and `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]`. Here is the problem, let me show how user update other queues.
1. Assume the size or `rolloverQueue` is 5.Alice queue up a rollover for the first time, the protocol will add to queue and update `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[Alice]  = 5`
```solidity
         rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );

ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```
2.After some time, others queued up and the size or `rolloverQueue` is 15. At this moment, Alice wants to update her queue. So the protocol will update the queue information and `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver]`, hence the `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[Alice ] = 15`.
```solidity
           uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;
```
3.Alice updates the queue again.As for the step 2 ,the index of the `rolloverQueue` for Alice becomes 15. The protocol will update information with array (15-1). Actually，the index of  `rolloverQueue` for Alice is (5-1). Hence, Alice successfully updated the queue information of others.
It is also possible to call the `delistInRollover` function to delete someone else's queue in this way.

## Impact
Users can update and delete others' queues at will

## Recommendation
Put the code `ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length` in the else branch

```solidity
      if (ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] != 0) {
            // if so, update the queue
            uint256 index = getRolloverIndex(_receiver);
            rolloverQueue[index].assets = _assets;
            rolloverQueue[index].epochId = _epochId;
            return
        } else {
            // if not, add to queue
            rolloverQueue.push(
                QueueItem({
                    assets: _assets,
                    receiver: _receiver,
                    epochId: _epochId
                })
            );
            ownerToRollOverQueueIndex[_receiver] = rolloverQueue.length;

        }
```
